# Write an analytics-focused resume

## Audience and Goal

Write for bots, humans, and bot-humans.
Bots scan for keywords, humans look for fuzzy positive signals, and bot-humans
are humans who are burned out from reading tons of resumes, so they're looking
for keywords but they also have good BS detectors. Alternatively, bot-humans are
third-party triage recruiters who are no better than a bot because they have no
domain experience. Getting an interview with one of these is good, but it isn't great,
because you could still get desk-rejected when your application hits the desk of someone
at the company who has a better idea of what they're looking for. Sadness.

I'm no job search savant by any means, but here are my views. Your sole goal
with cold-submission resume applications is to get an interview -- that's it. Imagine
that hundreds of other applicants are also submitting resumes. The search committee's
job is to narrow the pool of applicants, so they'll start with the widest filter,
and then work down.

Your job is to signal that you are _business-analytics relevant_.


## Content
Analytics-first! Classes, projects, skills. Be honest, but also proud!

Focus first on
adding all of your analytics-related feathers. Add content like the following:

* Degree title
* All job and educational experience to show job continuity
  * Emphasize analytics-_relevant_ job experience
* Specific related courses with verbose names, with high-level learning outcomes
  * See [example learning outcome verbs here](https://citl.indiana.edu/teaching-resources/course-design/developing-learning-outcomes/index.html). Tailor course-provided ones
    (check the syllabus), or write your own if you need to.
* If available, porfolio projects for those courses that demonstrate learning outcomes
  * link to jupyter notebooks (colab or github), blog posts, I dunno
* Add a list of analytics-related programming languages and libraries with which
  you have experience. [Example](https://imgur.com/gallery/r0SEEoh)

As you write your resume, you may identify gaps you want to be able to fill, or
portfolio pieces you wish you had. Create them! Then, come back and update your resume.


### Q: How do I tailor my resume content to a specific job application?

Look for keywords in the job listing, and (with honesty!) integrate those terms
and desired attributes into your resume. This is for the bots and the human-bots.


### Q: What about the "security" stuff?

I predict that the majority of the jobs that you will apply for will not be related
to security analytics. Therefore, emphasize _business analytics_ first, and add
security as a spice. If you find a more security-first job, write another resume
tailored to that job, with "security" first, and analytics second. If you find
a security-analytics-specific job, then that would be a third type.

A lot of companies are [interested in the cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ntPxdWAWq8). The security track gives you relevant computer networking
and cloud-computing experience. Also, a lot of tech toolbelts expect some kind
of container-computing skills, plus
attendant command-line mastery. The security track also gives you these.

Obviously, cybersecurity is sexy, and your portfolio pieces will be security-related,
which will have a high "cool!" factor. Just remember to explain the security concepts
to a lay audience.


### Q: Can I see some example resumes?

Maybe? I asked the previous security analytics generations if they'd share, stay tuned.


## Format

You may often need to basically copy-paste your resume into job applications.
Having your resume in markdown format may help streamline that process.

Write your resume in markdown. Post it as a new page on your GitHub Pages website.

# Job Search

I absolutely hate searching LinkedIn for jobs. But, it's probably one of the best places
to look.

Also, I asked my engineering neighbor what he does for job search:

> Indeed.com is a decent place to start. Then I start looking at the companies, what they do, who their competitors are. Then check out their competitors
>
> I also reach out to any vendors I've worked with in the past. A lot of times they have some good insights into what companies are hiring.



## FAQ:

### How many positions should I apply for?

Probably depends on the locale to which you are applying. Colorado Denver area is
an extremely high-supply (tough) analytics market right now though.


## Search Terms

Todo: ask past grads to share their experiences.
