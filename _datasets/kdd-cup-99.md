> This is the data set used for The Third International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools Competition, which was held in conjunction with KDD-99 The Fifth International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. The competition task was to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between 'bad' connections, called intrusions or attacks, and 'good' normal connections. This database contains a standard set of data to be audited, which includes a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment.

[UCI dataset](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html)

It's built in to sklearn datasets package,
available via [`sklearn.datasets.fetch_kddcup99`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_kddcup99.html)
