<div class='alert alert-danger'><strong>Warning: </strong> This dataset has <em>a lot of problems</em>. The website is down. The Kaggle dataset
only includes malicious samples for a tiny time window, so it's useless for ML. The raw
datafiles are only hosted on a Google Drive. The authors don't respond to access requests.</div>

The data collection method used is cool though.

Kaggle hosts a 2 week data sample from a single user [here](https://www.kaggle.com/BGU-CSRC/sherlock).
