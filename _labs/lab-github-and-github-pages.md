# Github

* Create a nice github account

  Create an account. Old people say "if you want a job, you must make a good
  LinkedIn profile." I say pfft. Make a good github
  (or other hosted code repo) profile instead and sk8 or die.

  * Choose your username being mindful that it'll be going on resumes, lol
  * Set a nice profile picture for yourself.
  * Set your name and organizational affiliation

  *Deliverable: submit a link to your github profile*

* Create a Github Pages resume webpage. For now, leave it with default index.html content.

  Using [this guide](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/), make a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site.

# Github Desktop

* Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
* Use GitHub Desktop to clone your github pages repository to your local computer

# Atom and Markdown

You need a nice text editor. I like [Atom](https://atom.io/). For this
lab, download and install Atom. After, if you hate it, you can abandon it.

* Download and install Atom
* Use Github Desktop to open your github pages repository in Atom
* Hook Atom up to GitHub [the package comes bundled with Atom, because Octocat](https://github.atom.io/).

Next, customize your index.html using the Markdown language, and then push your
local changes to your github-hosted GitHub Pages repository.

* Learn about Markdown. Specifically, read about [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

* Install the [markdown-preview](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview)
  atom plugin

* Write a resume landing page.

  For now, it should have _at least_ your name, an "about you"
  at least the length of a twitter bio, a profile picture of you, and a link to
  your github account.

* Using Atom, commit and push your changes.

**Deliverable: Screenshot committing and pushing your changes, demonstrating local git workflow.**

  Warning! Web dev is a sinkhole activity! You can spend _days_ on this, at the
  expense of your other work. Just stick to getting the basics up, then _get out_.

** Deliverable: A link to your website, and also a link to the backing github
repository.**
